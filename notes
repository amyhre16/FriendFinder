Consider using two tables to store data: one for name, pic; other for answer choices (look into how the relation would work)

when user clicks submit, check compatibility, display match, then push new user to table

to check compatibility, compare each potential match using Math.abs(). Store best match in object w/ id and compatibility score. Check each compatibility score against the current best match
